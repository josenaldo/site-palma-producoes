*The strategic, creative, and humanized perspective of Alê Karmirian and Emanuela Palma is focused on executing projects that promote a sense of belonging and awareness of socio-environmental balance. We came together in the production of the documentary 'Mestre Sirso,' an opportunity that created synergy for us to continue working together.

Investigating, connecting, designing, executing, and telling stories is what drives us and motivates us to create experiences that connect culture and sustainability in a journey of inspiration, creation, impact, and transformation.*
