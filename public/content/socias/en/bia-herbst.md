A marketer, photographer, lover of cinema and travel, Bia Herbst has worked in various professional sectors. From bookselling to advertising agencies and entertainment, she specialized in luxury marketing management, worked alongside renowned Brazilian and Italian photographers, and did the photography for the documentary 'Mestre Sirso.'

During her travels around the world, she had an epiphany. While she took pride in sharing the wonders of Brazil, she realized she wanted to delve even deeper into Brazilian culture and showcase its immense cultural and touristic potential to the world. Thus, she proposed to her friends Emanuela Palma and Alexandra Karmirian that they combine their talents to expand Palma Produções' scope of work together.
