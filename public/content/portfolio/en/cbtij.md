## Visual identity

The visual identity of the II CBTIJ Repertoire Showcase was conceived with the purpose of reflecting the richness of Brazilian cultural diversity, highlighting the essence of the ten theatrical performances presented.

With elements of popular culture and vibrant colors, we sought to convey the energy and plurality present in the performances, valuing the multiplicity of stories and perspectives explored during the showcase.

## Digital Design

Text: To expand the event's reach, in an accessible and attractive way, we developed the graphic materials for digital communication, exploring the richness of the elements of the visual identity we created for the project. The materials for each activity were created with a careful eye, bringing out the essence of the project.

## Magazine

The magazine is an inspiring record of the events of the II CBTIJ Repertoire Showcase. An editorial publication that delves into the narratives, photographs, and reflections that marked the main activities.

It is an honor for PALMA to participate in the realization of this editorial project, as it reinforces our commitment to initiatives that promote diversity and popular culture.
