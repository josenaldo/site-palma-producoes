## Book

The book "5 Sentidos Senses Sinne" by Momentos World - Artistic Cloud Center delves into the journey of dance-theater performance shows held in Austria, Germany, and Brazil, directed by the creator, producer, artistic director, and choreographer: Vinicius.

The project's intention was to create an artistic-biographical book with a dynamic, fluid, and artistic layout, non-linear yet harmonious. The idea was to convey movements, sensations, and vibrations, much like a dance, through photographs, graphics, typography, and colors. It was a challenging journey where the rational and emotional intertwined, and the tempo and rhythm were created with each page turn.

## Release

The book is one of the creations of the MOMENTOS WORLD project, taking the form of a physical, documentary book that explores the journey of dance-theater performances held in Austria, Germany, and Brazil, directed by the creator, producer, and artistic and choreographic director: Vinicius.

In celebration of the project's 10th anniversary, there was a desire to create a physical book that would detail the entire process of the project's birth, development, and structuring in three languages (Portuguese, German, and English). Simultaneously, the book will showcase a vast collection of photographs contributed by talented international photographers who have documented the 40 shows created by choreographer Vinicius in the "7 CITIES-MOMENTOS" (spanning three countries) over the last 10 years of the project's existence.

This book presents, in an artistic, documentary, and poetic manner, the transformation of a dance-theater performance project born in Vienna (2011).
