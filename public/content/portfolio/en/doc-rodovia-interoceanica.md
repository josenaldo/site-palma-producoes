## Project

The documentary "Interoceanic Highway: From the Amazon to the Pacific" was produced in 2009, directed by Emanuela Palma, Laelho Barroso, and Simone Norberto. The project stemmed from the need to address the integration between two countries that historically lived in isolation despite being geographically connected. The realization of this documentary became possible through the journalistic research grant from the Avina Foundation.

> The Avina Foundation is a global organization that promotes system-changing processes. We generate impact from the Global South, collaboratively, in pursuit of human dignity and planet care.

From its inception, the project of this highway aimed for much more than connecting two distant regions. It was a symbol of economic, touristic, and social integration between neighboring countries, promising to facilitate the flow of goods, people, and ideas.
