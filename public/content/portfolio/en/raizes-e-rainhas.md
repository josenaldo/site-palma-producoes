It is a pleasure for PALMA to contribute to the realization of the "Raízes e Rainhas" project, with a photographic essay that captures the result of several months of work at the Casa do Jongo da Serrinha in Rio de Janeiro in 2017.

Funded by the EMPODERA grant, sponsored by the Lojas Renner Institute and UN Women, the project offered a series of activities that had an impact on the textile industry while promoting women's empowerment.

The initiative included workshops on women's empowerment and featured a course on cutting, sewing, and pattern making. During the course, participants had the opportunity to acquire essential skills in clothing production while strengthening their self-esteem and sense of identity. The garments created during the course were worn in the photo sessions, creating a visual celebration of Afro-Brazilian culture and the identity of the Black women involved in the project.
